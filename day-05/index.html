    <h2>Loops and Iterations</h2>

    <h3>
      Loop means doing the same task or execute a block of code repeatedly
      without writing the code for every repitition.
    </h3>

    <h3>
      Loops are used when we want to automate repetitive tasks, like printing
      numbers, checking items in a list, or performing calculations repeatedly.
    </h3>

    <h3>Types of Loop</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          for loop - best for fixed number of looping/iteration or when we know
          how many times we need to run a block of code.
        </p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          while loop - A while loop runs as long as given condition is true.
          It's best when we don't know in advance how many iterations are
          needed.
        </p>
        <img src="./Images/while loop.png" alt="">
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          do while loop - A do while loop ensures execute the code at least once
          before checking the conditions
        </p>
        <img src="./Images/do while loop.png" alt="">
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4>Break and continue</h4>
        <p>
          Break is for existing from the loop so that no more iteration. <br />
          Continue is for skipping a particular iteration in a loop and go to
          the next one.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
