## About Me

Hi! I'm currently learning JavaScript and building my fundamentals through the 40 Days of JavaScript course by **Tapas Adhikary**. This repository is a reflection of my growth, practice, and consistency.

I’m excited to document this journey and share it publicly, both for accountability and to help others who might be on a similar path.

Let’s code every day. One day at a time. 💻🔥
